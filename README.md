# ReactRiot 2017

## Team Overlooper

Yours truly [@kelset](https://twitter.com/Kelset) and [@erdogmusergun](https://twitter.com/erdogmusergun) are going to delight you all with their amazing coding skills for the next 48 hrs ü§ñ

## Our purpose

We pursuit 3 main objectives during this hackathon:

1. Having fun üï∫

1. Learning something new ü§ì

1. Creating some awesome stuff with ‚öõÔ∏è

## The actual project

The current base idea is a "help people find people for share common interest to participate together to an event" sort of website.

To get an overall understanding, we are currently sort-of using/trying to use:

* [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* [`react-apollo`](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo)
* [`react-modal`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal)
* [`react-router`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* [`react-helmet`](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)
* [`styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)

And, on the backend:

* [`Graphcool`](https://www.graph.cool/)
* [`Auth0`](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/integrations/auth0-naed3eecie/)

## How-Tos

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[Read more about testing.](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests)

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
